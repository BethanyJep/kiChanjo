# COVID-19-Vaccine-Data

Project tasks:
To understand how the progress of vaccination programs around the World (or in a specific country) is received by the public, as reflected in the tweets about all vaccines.

Combine datasets with tweets about vaccines and vaccination progress to analyze relationship between vaccination evolution and sentiment toward vaccinations

Combine sentiment analysis, topic analysis, or at least frequent concepts analysis trends with vaccine programme evolution to understand relationship between public vaccination programmes actions and public reception;


## Twitter Data Analysis
 Visualization 
   using word clouds to check word frequency
 Location and vaccine used
 Cleaning Twitter Data
Visualizing data per time period
Indicate: vaccine location, number of people vaccinated in the time period, type of vaccine used
Study the subjects of recent tweets about the vaccine made by various producers;
Perform various NLP tasks on this data source (topic modelling, sentiment analysis);
Streaming data from Twitter

## Vaccine Data Analysis
Data Cleaning: fixing missing data
Visualizing Data

üåç did the number of vaccinations shots change over time for the whole world?
üìä did the number of vaccinations shots change over time per continent?
üèÉ‚Äç Which country has the best performance?
üèÜ How far is each country from herd immunity?
ü§ù Which vaccines are used in different countries?
Visualizing Data Per time period
Indicate: vaccine location, number of people vaccinated in the time period, type of vaccine used
